## Networking at A AWS is called teh virtual private cloud

###Goals
1. have a strong understanding of VPCs
2. networking services and options available

- subnet is the lowest level we can gain access to, and it is at a virtual level

#### Topics for this chapter include the following
1. VPC networking
2. Subnets and IP address types 
- Route table
- Security groups and NACLs
- VPN connectivity options
- Route 53 - the domain name system (DNS) service

#### Terra Firma
1. Management agrees that the current HR system must be migrated to AWS as soon as possible
2. The company's HR system needs to be able to properly scale to handle the increased demand of upper Management
3. The human resources system must be available 24


Some of questions they need to get answered include these
1. How many VPCs should Terra Firma consider using?
2. How many AZs should Terra Firma use to design for failover
3. How many subnets should Terra Firma use?
4. Do you Web servers need public or private IP addresses?
5. Can we privately access AWS resources from within a VPC
6. Are NAT services required?
7. Compliance rules mandate Security at the subnet level


#### VPC Networking
Official name EC2-VPC
Each VPC isolated "data center" where your computer instances and various AWS services reside.

Software that can run successfully on a Windows or Linux virtual serveer can be hosted on EC2 instances hosted in VPCs running as Web/application servers,databases, NAT servers or any third-party Software

Order a VPC, AWS's job is securing your VPC as private isolated software data center linked to your AWS account

A VPC also has multiple connectivity options, allowing you to connect your VPC to the Internet, to your own private data center, to other VPCs within your region or outside your region or to other AWs accounts holders' VPCs


#### Partnering with AWS
Hosting your applications in the Amazon public cloud means you have implicity accepted to work with partnership with AWS in what is typically defined as a shared security model.
 AWS: building and securing its clound infrastructure
 yours: design acceptable security provisions for your applications and data hosted within the AWS cloud

 ### To host or to Associate

 Some of these services will have relationships with the service and components hosted inside a VPC, but the services themselves are not actually installed in the VPC

 They reside on the private or public Amazon network and once ordered or selected are then associated or linked to the chosen VPC carrying out their task.

 The primary service hosted in the VPC is the EC2 instances.

 ### What's Behind the Networking Curtain
 Each VPC is a software-defined network built on Amazon's own code and custom network hardware developed by AWS to match its required scale of network operations.

 There are two networks at AWS: 
 1. the real physical network that is maintained by AWS, along with physical switches and routers and familiar networking components
 2. the underlying physical network at AWS would be quite recognizable to the physical network

 - Each VPC runs on top of the physical AWS network infrastructure.

 ### The Mapping service
 - is a fully distributed service in charge of mapping VPCs and their associated network interfaces and the physical locations of each VPC.

 ### Creating your first VPC
 - name tag: name of the VPC being created
 - initial IPv4 CIDR block you want to see for the VPC

 VPC with a Single Public Subnets
 VPC with Public and Private Subnets
 - public and private subnets allows you to create an environment for a multitier application.
 - The public subnets would be utilized for network address translation NAT servers or additional public-facing services such as load-balancing servicesa.
 - VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN access
 - VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN access

 ### How Many VPCs
