## Networking at A AWS is called teh virtual private cloud

###Goals
1. have a strong understanding of VPCs
2. networking services and options available

- subnet is the lowest level we can gain access to, and it is at a virtual level

#### Topics for this chapter include the following
1. VPC networking
2. Subnets and IP address types 
- Route table
- Security groups and NACLs
- VPN connectivity options
- Route 53 - the domain name system (DNS) service

#### Terra Firma
1. Management agrees that the current HR system must be migrated to AWS as soon as possible
2. The company's HR system needs to be able to properly scale to handle the increased demand of upper Management
3. The human resources system must be available 24


Some of questions they need to get answered include these
1. How many VPCs should Terra Firma consider using?
2. How many AZs should Terra Firma use to design for failover
3. How many subnets should Terra Firma use?
4. Do you Web servers need public or private IP addresses?
5. Can we privately access AWS resources from within a VPC
6. Are NAT services required?
7. Compliance rules mandate Security at the subnet level


#### VPC Networking
Official name EC2-VPC
Each VPC isolated "data center" where your computer instances and various AWS services reside.

Software that can run successfully on a Windows or Linux virtual serveer can be hosted on EC2 instances hosted in VPCs running as Web/application servers,databases, NAT servers or any third-party Software

Order a VPC, AWS's job is securing your VPC as private isolated software data center linked to your AWS account

A VPC also has multiple connectivity options, allowing you to connect your VPC to the Internet, to your own private data center, to other VPCs within your region or outside your region or to other AWs accounts holders' VPCs


#### Partnering with AWS
Hosting your applications in the Amazon public cloud means you have implicity accepted to work with partnership with AWS in what is typically defined as a shared security model.
 AWS: building and securing its clound infrastructure
 yours: design acceptable security provisions for your applications and data hosted within the AWS cloud

 ### To host or to Associate

 Some of these services will have relationships with the service and components hosted inside a VPC, but the services themselves are not actually installed in the VPC

 They reside on the private or public Amazon network and once ordered or selected are then associated or linked to the chosen VPC carrying out their task.

 The primary service hosted in the VPC is the EC2 instances.

 ### What's Behind the Networking Curtain
 Each VPC is a software-defined network built on Amazon's own code and custom network hardware developed by AWS to match its required scale of network operations.

 There are two networks at AWS: 
 1. the real physical network that is maintained by AWS, along with physical switches and routers and familiar networking components
 2. the underlying physical network at AWS would be quite recognizable to the physical network

 - Each VPC runs on top of the physical AWS network infrastructure.

 ### The Mapping service
 - is a fully distributed service in charge of mapping VPCs and their associated network interfaces and the physical locations of each VPC.

 ### Creating your first VPC
 - name tag: name of the VPC being created
 - initial IPv4 CIDR block you want to see for the VPC

 VPC with a Single Public Subnets
 VPC with Public and Private Subnets
 - public and private subnets allows you to create an environment for a multitier application.
 - The public subnets would be utilized for network address translation NAT servers or additional public-facing services such as load-balancing servicesa.
 - VPC with Public and Private Subnets and Hardware VPN access
 - VPC with a Private Subnet Only and Hardware VPN access

 ### How Many VPCs
- 0ne region 5 VPCs
A single VPC can host many subnets and instances and have private connectivity back to the corporate data center.
- you are an independent developer creating an application that will be available across the Internet to users around the Internet to users around the world.
 Eg. 3 VPC :
    - development workspace
    - test workspace
    - a produciton workspace
- you're an admisnistrator who has been tasked with utilizing cloud storated at AWS -> Storage, not need VPC
- we can work with multiple VPCs and multiple accounts with VPCs but it's a reat idea to have some long-term plan perhaps 2 to 3 yeaars out if possible
- You work for a large company that is hosted in many different countries wiht different languages. Your company wants absolute separation; multiple VPCs can be created.

### Creating the VPC CIDR block
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 subnets are supported within a VPC, however, it is required that VPCs and subnets have an initial IPv4 CIDR block defined first
- IPv6 CIDR blocks can be associated with your VPC, but only after an initial IPv4 CIDR block has been created
- CIDR blocks must not overlap with any existing CIDR blocks associated within a VPC or with another VPC connected with peering connection 
- The size. of an existing CIDR block cannot be increased or decreased; it is locked after creation

### Planing your primary VPC CIDR block
- Ask the networking team and get advice on what Ip address ranges you should use at AWS
Notes: The primary IPv4 CIDR block that you choose for your VPC will determine the number and size of IPv4 addresses that can be assigned to the subnets created within the VPC.
Using additional secondary CIDR blocks in a few pages

Let's start with the example of 192.168.0.0
for your VPC starting CIDR address, the network mask you choose will determine the number of possible hosts that can be contained on subnets within your single VPC

### Adding a Secondary CIDR block
the additional secondary CIDR block can not be larger than the initial primary CIDR block
Primary  10.0.0.0/24
Secondary: the same or larger is not allowed 

### The Default VPC
The default VPC can be deleted. If you want to bring it back, AWS provides a script to recreate it. You also can't assign an existing VPC to become default VPC

### Revisiting Availability Zones
- Desing for resiliency and failover with multiple AZs in a single VPC
- Load-balance instances hosted on subnets in different AZs

### Creating Subnets
It's usually stated that a VPC spans "all of the availability zones within its region"
AZs don't show up automatically in each VPC 
AZs have been designed with isolation from other AZs
private subnet: no gateway or endpoint to direct traffic to
public subnet: is routed to the internet through an internet gateway
sumary:
    - contained within an AZs
    - host compute instances
    - public subnets allow you access to the internet
    - public subnets are for infrastructure
    - private subnets are private with no Internet access
    - private subnets are where instances live privately

### NAT services
- ordered and linked to a public subnet to allow EC2 instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet and receive required os 
- always placed in a public subnet and configured with an elastic IP address 
Sumary: 
-   used so EC2 instances residing on private subnets can get required updated
- hosted AWS cloud service with no need to install or maintain an EC2 instances
- is merely and instance configured for NAT duties


### Working with Route Tables
the main route table also defines the routing for all subnets that are not explicitly associated with any other custom route table after they are created.

Every subnet when it's created is automatically assigned to the main route table of a VPC. This is a protective step as the assumption is made that the main route table will only provide local routing throughout the VPC.
